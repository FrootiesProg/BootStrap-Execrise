              A pitaya (/pɪˈtaɪ.ə/) or pitahaya (/ˌpɪtəˈhaɪ.ə/) is the fruit of
              several different cactus species indigenous to the region of
              southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa
              Rica, and El Salvador.[1][2] Pitaya is cultivated in East Asia,
              South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, the Caribbean,
              Australia, and throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the
              world.

            <h1>Passion Fruit</h1>
            <p>
              The passion fruit is so called because it is one of the many
              species of passion flower, the English translation of the Latin
              genus name, Passiflora, and may be spelled "passion fruit",
              "passionfruit", or "passion-fruit".[1][4] Around 1700, the name
              was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid while
              trying to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Christianity; its
              name was flor das cinco chagas or "flower of the five wounds" to
              illustrate the crucifixion of Christ and his resurrection,[5] with
              other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion
              of Jesus.[4]
